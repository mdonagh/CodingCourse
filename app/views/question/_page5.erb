FOR LOOP

There are many times when you need to run a block of code multiple times. 

This is called “iterating.” The letter “i” stands for iterator. 


for(var i = 0; i < 3;i++)
{
console.log(i);  // prints 0, 1, 2 3
}

var i = 0; 
sets the variable i to 0.

i < 3
The code block will continue running until this condition becomes untrue

i++
This means that i will be increased by 1 each time after the loop has run. 

This is just a shorthand for i+1


This can also be something else, like i-2 would subtract 2 from i every time the loop is run. i-- subtract 1 from i each time the loop is run

for(var i = 3; i > 0;i-1)
{
console.log(i);  // prints 3, 2, 1, 0
}
