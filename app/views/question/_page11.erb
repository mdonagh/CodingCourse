for(var i = 17; i < 25; i++)
{
if( i > 21)
{
console.log(i);
}
}

What will this print?

<div class="hint">
i starts off set to 17, and will increase by one each time the loop is run. 
It will run until i < 25 is false
The if statement looks like i will only print if the value is greater than 21.
</div>

<div class="answer">
22, 23, 24
</div>
