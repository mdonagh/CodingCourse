I’m going to put a lot of comprehension questions to make sure you’ve got these basics down, then you can write some code of your own.

If you want to cheat and run this code yourself, you can go to a site like JSFiddle that can run javascript for you, or

make a file - example.html

put the content in it like this:

<%= "<html>" %><br>
<%= "<script>" %><br>
// Your code here
<%= "console.log(“hello world!”);" %><br>
<%= "</script>" %><br>
<%= "</html>" %>

Open it in a browser. I prefer Google Chrome.

Right click -> Inspect

Click Console

There is the output of your javascript program!
