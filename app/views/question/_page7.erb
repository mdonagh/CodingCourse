for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
console.log(i);
}

What will this print?

<div class="hint">
i starts off set to zero, and will increase by one each time the loop is run. 
It will run until i < 10 is false, so that means 
at i = 10
10 < 10 = FALSE
</div>
<div class="answer">
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
</div>

<%= render "answer_box" %>
