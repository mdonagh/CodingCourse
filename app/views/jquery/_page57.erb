<p>To use JQuery, you will have to include the library on your page. You can either download JQuery and include the script locally, or you can just download it from googleâ€™s content delivery network by just including the following somewhere on your HTML page:</p>

<div class="code_block">

<%= 'script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>' %>
</div>

<p>Remember, any problem you might with JQuery has probably been solved before - just GOOGLE for something like "how do I get the value of a text input form in JQuery"</p>
<p>You just need to know how to find and use pieces of code to accomplish your goal. You don't have to memorize a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>The browser console often shows useful errors as well.</p>
<p>Try building one single part of your programs at a time - then, when you have tested it and make sure that piece works, move on to the next operation you need.</p>
